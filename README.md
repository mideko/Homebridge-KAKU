# Homebridge-KAKU
homebridge module for KlikAanKlikUit / CoCo / Trust ICS-2000

Building on the great work of Youri Dijk.

I've mainly extended some of the KaKu types, in particular for RGB/Hue Lightbulbs
All in JS, not TypeScript.

Requires the NPM module color-convert

Not packaged yet, sorry, so only manual install
